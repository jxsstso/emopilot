      “The moment you name your emotion and observe it, it begins to lose its power.”  
      <br>— Daniel J. Siegel, <em>The Whole-Brain Child</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Since ancient times, wise people have learned to separate themselves from their emotions and observe them.<br>
    Yet in modern life, many of us still feel overwhelmed or even trapped by intense emotions.</p>

    <p>This app is more than just a mood journal.<br>
    It’s a tool designed to help you observe your emotions with clarity and safety.<br>
    This app offers a secure space where you can reflect on your emotions, on your own terms.</p>

     <p>
      At first, it may feel unfamiliar or even difficult to observe your emotions or put them into words.  
      That’s completely okay.
    </p>

    <p>
      To help you get started, Emopilot offers a range of emotion options — from simple, basic feelings to more subtle and nuanced ones.  
      Take your time to look through them and choose the emotions that feel closest to how you're feeling right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if you don’t see a label that feels quite right, or if you'd like to describe your feelings in your own words,  
      you can always add your own custom emotions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This space is yours — a place where you can gently explore, define, and express what you’re going through,  
      in the way that feels most true to you.
    </p>

    <p>By choosing your emotions one at a time, you can take a closer look at how you're feeling.<br>
    As you reflect on ways to cope, the app helps you explore the kind of care you may need.</p>

    <p>The app’s <strong>"Advice"</strong> feature can offer gentle guidance or encouragement, 
      helping you see your emotions more objectively and feel supported.</p>

    <p>All your records are securely saved in your iCloud,<br>
    and you’ll be able to review simple statistics about your feelings and coping methods.<br>
    This way, you can gradually develop deeper insight and self-awareness over time.</p>

    <p>As you continue using this app,<br>
    we hope you’ll become the one who leads your emotions — and your life.</p>
