      <blockquote style="color: yellow;">
        “The moment you name you emotion and observe it, it begins to lose its power.”<br>
        — Daniel J. Siegel, <em>The Whole-Brain Child</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Since ancient times, wise people have known how to step back and observe their emotions.<br>
      Yet many of us today still find ourselves overwhelmed or consumed by strong feelings.</p>

      <p>As a result, we often avoid or suppress emotions, believing that doing so is rational or proper.  
      Sometimes it’s because we find them too much to handle, or external situations force us to. <br>
      But emotions arise for valid reasons — and they eventually need to be acknowledged and expressed. <br>
      Suppressed emotions can affect both the body and mind, often worsening our emotional state over time.</p>

      <p>This app is more than just a journal.<br>
      It’s a tool to help you recognize, face, and organize your emotions with clarity.<br>
      In a safe and private space, EmoPilot supports you in observing what you feel — honestly and without judgment.</p>

      <p>At first, facing or expressing emotions might feel awkward or unfamiliar.<br>
      EmoPilot provides a wide range of emotional categories, from basic to nuanced and complex.<br>
      Try slowly selecting the feelings that resonate with your current state.</p>

      <p>If you don’t find a suitable option or prefer your own language,<br>
      you can always add custom emotions.<br>
      Use the app as a tool to discover, define, and express your feelings in your own words.</p>

      <p>As you select each emotion, you begin to explore your state of mind.<br>
      And by considering coping strategies, you take steps toward caring for yourself.</p>

      <p>Through the <strong>“Get Advice”</strong> feature,  
      you can receive objective feedback, support, or the encouragement to face your emotions head-on.</p>

      <p>All records are securely saved to your iCloud,<br>
      and you can review simple statistics on your moods and responses,<br>
      helping you reflect on your emotional patterns and growth.</p>

      <p>Through this process of recording and reflecting with EmoPilot,  
      may you become not just aware of your emotions — but the true pilot of your emotional life.</p>
