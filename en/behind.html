    </blockquote>

    <p>Since ancient times, wise people have learned to separate themselves from their emotions and observe them.<br>
    Yet in modern life, many of us still feel overwhelmed or even trapped by intense emotions.</p>

    <p>This app is more than just a mood journal.<br>
    It’s a tool designed to help you observe your emotions with clarity and safety.<br>
    This app offers a secure space where you can reflect on your emotions, on your own terms.</p>

    <p>By choosing your emotions one at a time, you can take a closer look at how you're feeling.<br>
    As you reflect on ways to cope, the app helps you explore the kind of care you may need.</p>

    <p>The app’s <strong>"Advice"</strong> feature can offer gentle guidance or encouragement, helping you see your emotions more objectively and feel supported.</p>

    <p>All your records are securely saved in your iCloud,<br>
    and you’ll be able to review simple statistics about your feelings and coping methods.<br>
    This way, you can gradually develop deeper insight and self-awareness over time.</p>

    <p>As you continue using this app,<br>
    we hope you’ll become the one who leads your emotions — and your life.</p>
