      <h1 class="center-title">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

      <h3 class="highlight">1. What do I need to use the app after installation?</h3>
      <p>EmoPilot uses iCloud to securely store your emotion records.<br>
      Therefore, you must be logged into your iCloud account and have an active internet connection for server authentication.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">2. How long does the free trial last and are there any feature limits?</h3>
      <p>The free trial period lasts for 24 hours after the app is installed.<br>
      During this time, most features are available without restrictions,<br>
      but the "Advice" feature is limited to a maximum of 2 uses.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">3. If I subscribe, how many times can I use the app and the AI advice?</h3>
      <p>All app features like emotion logging, editing, and statistics are available without usage limits.<br>
      The AI advice feature allows up to 3 uses per day, with a monthly maximum of 60 uses.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">4. How can I cancel my subscription or request a refund?</h3>
      <p>You can cancel your subscription or request a refund from the 'Information → Cancel Subscription' of Main Tap in the app.<br>
      EmoPilot follows Apple’s subscription and refund policies.<br>
      Please refer to Apple’s support page for detailed steps.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">5. How were the emotion and coping lists created?</h3>
      <p>EmoPilot’s emotion and coping lists are based on psychological theories and real user experiences, rather than strict medical criteria.<br>
      These lists are not definitive, but are designed to help users explore their feelings and build their own personalized lists.<br>
      You can freely add or delete any item.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">6. What languages does the app support? Will more be added?</h3>
      <p>Currently, Korean and English are supported, with more languages planned in the future.<br>
      Updates on language support will be shared through the official website.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">7. What system does the AI use? Does it store my emotions or text?</h3>
      <p>EmoPilot’s advice feature is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT 3.5 model.<br>
      Your input is encrypted and sent to the server only for processing responses, and is not stored.<br>
      For more details, please refer to our privacy policy.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">8. Are there any restrictions or prohibited content when using the AI?</h3>
      <p>Inputs that contain violence, hate speech, or sexually explicit content — which violate OpenAI’s content policies — are restricted.<br>
      Repeated violations may result in usage limitations.<br>
      To ensure safe use, AI inputs are internally filtered and monitored.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">9. Why is user information kept for one year?</h3>
      <p>To prevent repeated free trials and verify subscription status, EmoPilot retains user data for a limited period.<br>
      Even after unsubscribing, your information remains on the server for one year and is automatically deleted afterward.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">10. Where are my emotion records stored? Are they secure?</h3>
      <p>Your records are saved in your personal iCloud, and the developer has no access to them.<br>
      iCloud also enables synchronization across devices, and your data is protected by Apple’s security systems.</p>

      <h3 class="highlight">11. Will my records be deleted if I uninstall the app?</h3>
      <p>Your records will remain in iCloud even if the app is deleted.<br>
      When you reinstall the app and log in with the same Apple ID, your previous records will be restored.<br>
      However, if iCloud was disabled or you didn’t manually back up before deletion, some data may not be recoverable.</p>
